This is a brainstorm of thoughts and questions about the Caltech image pipeline for the Roman Space Telescope

While it starts with the image reception part of the pipeline, the entries are allowed to be random order in order to encourage the brainstorming process.

=========================================================================

- Will the Caltech image pipeline be the repository responsible for safeguarding the existence of the images?
    - How secure and fault tolerant should the image, image event, image event subscriber, and image event alerts databases be?
- Will there be scheduled offline periods in image stream?
    - How will these be communicated to the pipeline or Caltech?
- Is it expected that there will be few or many unanticpated disruptions in the image stream?
    - How will these be sensed by the image pipeline?
    - What should the image pipeline do in this case?
- Will there be more than one type of image received?
- Will the images vary in width, height or "color/greyscale" density?
- What is the mechanism of image delivery to the pipeline?
- What is the rate of image delivery to the pipeline (i.e., images per hour)
- Is the image delivery bursty?
