This is a brainstorm of thoughts and questions about the Caltech image pipeline for the Roman Space Telescope

Language
--------

- an image event is an image that has a positive result when analyzed with a particular technique


=========================================================================

Image Receiving
---------------

- Will the Caltech image pipeline be the primary repository responsible for safeguarding the long-term existence of the images?
    - if not, how long should images be kept?
    - How secure and fault tolerant should the image, image event, image event subscriber, and image event alerts databases be?
- Will there be scheduled offline periods in image stream?
    - How will these be communicated to the pipeline or Caltech?
- Is it expected that there will be few or many unanticpated disruptions in the image stream?
    - How will these be sensed by the image pipeline?
    - What should the image pipeline do in this case?
- What type(s)/size(s) of images will be received?
- What is the mechanism of image delivery to the pipeline?
- What is the rate of image delivery to the pipeline (e.g., images per hour)
- Is the image delivery rate constant or highly variable?
- How much of a possibility is there of an image being corrupt?
- Are there multiple types of images that needed to be handled separately because
  of the telescope using its technology in a different way?
- what info will be provided in addition to the image itself?


Image Analysis
--------------

- How many analysis techniques will be appled to the images?
- What is the maximum image lag used in analyzing a current image?
- Is there a possbility of an analysis technique being changed or its
  tolerances adjusted so that past image events would no longer be image events
  or vice versa?
     - what should be done in this case?
     - it may be that an image analysis technique should have version numbers
- does IPAC have access to already written code for image analysis techniques
  that will be used in the image pipeline?
     - even if it's not Python code, we could still likely interface with it,
       thereby saving time if the code is good enough


Image Event Alerts
------------------

- How is it envisioned that people will subscribe to image events they are interested in?
- Will this process be open to the public without a login process?
- What kind of alerts will be sent? Emails? Texts?
- How should email alert failures be handled?
- How long will a person's image event subscription remain active
- How many subscribers is anticpated?


Image Event Viewer (standalone)
-------------------------------

- Is it anticipated that this front-end be a Python GUI or a webpage?
- Will people be allowed to view alerts they have have not subscribed to?
- Will people be allowed to download images associated with an image event?
