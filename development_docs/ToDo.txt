To Do for mock image pipeline
-----------------------------

- investigate ramifications of using -u="root" in docker run command
- automate the process of building/running the Apache Kafka image/container and opening the command line
  windows for the python Kafka clients and running them
- finish removing improper uses of exceptions (have done a lot of this already)
- add exceptions where called for (e.g., multiple tries when a database connection/cursor/query or
  object storage client/upload/download initially fails)
- improve/add logging and sys.exit() code (note: logging does not automatically include sys.exit() output)
